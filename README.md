# Touchdown

I've taken the code from the [SwiftUI Masterclass - iOS Development with Swift and SwiftData](https://www.udemy.com/share/102drs3@PvA5PL1g7ytBJTHvvsIwDjh4yTTBgbnhK4AuooQQBueYzimC59gm3jVmpTCXF8Uq/), and I'm building an MVVM structure. The goals are:

- [ ] Migrate to a robust architecture
- [ ] Create a login screen
- [ ] Create a cart screen
- [ ] Improve data access
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles to the application
